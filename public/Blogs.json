    "description": "While it might not be to everyone’s liking, we really dig the Kiral’s camo color scheme, it beats seeing yet another solid black bike and gives it a styleall its own.Intriguingly, it also stands to highlight some of the key shapes and forms of the frame while masking others.When it comes to the equipment Kuota’s UK people offer a number of optional builds based on the same £1,725 frameset, from a budget-conscious Shimano 105 selection up to a blowout Dura-Ace Di2, and a range of Mavic wheels.It makes the bikes highly customizable without an endless list of options that simply confuse.Components include the highly respected Deda Zero2 bar and stem, with the perch selected as San Marco’s Concor saddle.",
