## Feature
* This is my best project called Inventory Management.
* First, in my project overview if I say that what kind of benefits the user will get on my website is that the user will get product update delivery, manage , add and better user experience
* If Users not Login then users can see the Banner Section, WhyChoose Section, Service Section, Inventory Section, Review Section, Available App Section, Contact Section and Footer Section on the homepage.
* If the user clicks on the inventory item button on the homepage, then the user can update the product. if the user clicks on the deliver button, then the quantity of the inventory item will decrease one by one, and if the user gives any value in the input on the right side, then the quantity of the inventory item will be added.
* If the user clicks on the manage button, the user can manage products and there are two buttons. if user want can add new products and delete them.

* If the user clicks on the plus icon to add a new product, it will appear on the My Items and Manage page. In My Items, the user can see only the items he has added, and from that page, the user can add and delete products. This website is three breakpoints responsive.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
