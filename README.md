* If the user clicks on the inventory item button on the homepage, then the user can update the product. if the user clicks on the deliver button, then the quantity of the inventory item will decrease one by one, and if the user gives any value in the input on the right side, then the quantity of the inventory item will be added.
* If the user clicks on the manage button, the user can manage products and there are two buttons. if user want can add new products and delete them.

* If the user clicks on the plus icon to add a new product, it will appear on the My Items and Manage page. In My Items, the user can see only the items he has added, and from that page, the user can add and delete products. This website is three breakpoints responsive.
